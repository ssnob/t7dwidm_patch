# Fair Warning
This is a third party tool and as such may violate the EULA you agree to when playing BO3\
This would then also violate the posted security enforcement policy posted by treyarch\
As such, please be aware that if treyarch decides this tool is malicious, they have the right to ban you\
Please also be aware that VAC does not currently pick this tool up, so VAC isnt a problem\
Treyarch anti-cheat (TAC), is no longer banning on BO3, at this moment in time\
**This means that effectively the chances of you getting banned are almost ZERO**, but by request of several people, I give you fair warning.

# Extra info to the people saying this is malware
I've been told someone got DDoSed shortly after using the patch... My tool isnt the issue. \
\
BO3 (and all treyarch cods) allow anyone who has your gamertag to pull your IP address through in game functionality. \
\
The invite system on the game sends your IP address to whoever tries to join you - how else would their machine know where to open a connection to? \
\
This is just the nature of a P2P game. \
\
This means that regardless of your privacy settings, if your XUID gets leaked, your IP address is also leaked. Use a VPN. \
\
If you still think that it is malware, build it from source. It is pretty difficult to hide malware in an open source tool.
