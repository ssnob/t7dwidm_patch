# Fair Warning
This is a third party tool and as such may violate the EULA you agree to when playing BO3\
This would then also violate the posted security enforcement policy posted by treyarch\
As such, please be aware that if treyarch decides this tool is malicious, they have the right to ban you\
Please also be aware that VAC does not currently pick this tool up, so VAC isnt a problem\
Treyarch anti-cheat (TAC), is no longer banning on BO3, at this moment in time\
**This means that effectively the chances of you getting banned are almost ZERO**, but by request of several people, I give you fair warning.
